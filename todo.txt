This emulator supports two disk formats one about 8mb the other 51.

Previously the simh emulator had and least two disk formats 1.1mb and 8mb.
Id like to be able use the simh disks with our emulator and have
them be automaticlly recognized.

For sample simh disks see ~/esrc/8080 *.dsk.  For most .dsk file
there is a file of the same name which is a simh command file
to attach the .dsk

The simh source are in ~/esrc/simh then Altair8800 or AltairZ80

It is possible we already support simh files.  If so it may be
a matter of saying hd512 is a simh format.

I don't know about the 1.1mb .dsk files

In summary, support the simh disk formats. Update the README and docs saying we do and give examples of mounting a simh .dsk
